				<p>1. Once an order is confirmed with payment, it cannot be cancelled or modified under any circumstances.</p>
                <p>2. Payments are only accepted after stock availability is confirmed. In rare instances where we cannot provide the selected card after payment, we will either request a change in selection, ask for additional time to produce the card, or issue a full refund.</p>
                <p>3. The responsibility of paying local taxes, such as VAT or customs duty, lies with the customer. Please consult your local authorities regarding applicable taxes. In many countries, there is no customs duty for printed wedding cards purchased for personal use. Local taxes are not included in the price of the card.</p>
                <p>4. In India, we provide an invoice with GST. If you wish to claim a GST refund, please include your GST number with your order.</p>
                <p>5. While we maintain adequate stock of all cards, there may be occasions when the sample you selected is out of stock. In such cases, you can choose an alternative card.</p>
                <p>6. We reserve the right to print our logo, website, and card code on the card, cover, and insert. However, these will not interfere with the content of the card.</p>
                
				<p>7. Card customization is done at our sole discretion.</p>
                
				<p>8. We take great care to ensure that the final product matches the sample. However, there may be minor variations in color or the thickness/texture of the material due to the nature of the materials used. These cannot be considered defects. Rest assured, quality checks are conducted at our end.</p>
                
				<p>9. Colors on monitors may vary, and the actual card colors may not match exactly. We recommend ordering a sample before making your final decision.</p>
                
				<p>10. We are fully responsible for any printing errors in the final cards after you have approved the proofs. However, we are not responsible for any errors, no matter how minor, present in the proof that you approved. Please carefully review all proofs.</p>
                
				<p>11. Minor variations in printed text colors may occur, as the process is manual.</p>
                
				<p>12. Envelopes are not self-adhesive by default.</p>
                
				<p>13. We use reliable couriers and transport services but are not responsible for delays in transit or damages that occur during shipping. The customer should address any issues directly with the transporter. We ensure proper packing and quality checks before shipping.</p>

				<p>14. All invoices and receipts will be issued under "Ruby Cardz," the company that manufactures the cards and owns the "Ruby Cardz" brand.</p>

				<p>15. Customers are entitled to three free proof corrections. Additional changes to the layout or text will incur a fee.</p>

				<p>16. The printing process is carried out in good faith. We are not liable if the final product does not meet your expectations, as layouts are always approved by you, and colors are printed according to your preferences. If you require absolute certainty, we recommend paying for printed proofs and the corresponding courier charges.</p>

				<p>17. It is the customer's responsibility to select an appropriately sized card. Choosing a card that is too small to accommodate your desired text may cause complications.</p>

				<p>18. For any issues not covered in these terms, our decision will be final. If you have any specific concerns, please contact us directly via email or phone. Do not make assumptions.</p>

				<p>19. For design-your-own cards, our responsibility is limited to supplying the cards as per the online edits made by you. Please ensure you thoroughly check the content before giving final approval.</p>

                <p>20. All transactions are subject to the jurisdiction of Tuticorine courts.</p>
