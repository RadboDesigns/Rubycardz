				<h6>1. General Information:</h6>
				<p>We are a leading manufacturer of wedding cards in India. Visit our corporate website www.rubycardz.com. This large-scale production is why our prices are competitive.</p>
                <p>We focus on manufacturing and selling only high-quality products, so you can trust the quality of our cards.</p>
                <p>Lower prices do not equate to lower quality—we operate on a high-volume production model.</p>
                <p>Please note that the appearance of cards may vary slightly depending on your monitor, and colors on your screen may not be an exact match to the physical card.</p>
                <p>It’s difficult to capture the precise look and feel of a card on a screen. We recommend reviewing a physical sample before making a final decision.</p>
                <p>Our network includes 3 owned showrooms.</p>
                
				<h6>2. How can I view the actual card(s) before placing a final order?</h6>
				<p>You directly visit our branches or you can order samples directly from our website. For a fee of Rs.500 (India) or USD 50, you can select up to 5 samples. This price includes courier charges. Please note that this is the minimum charge, and the cost remains the same even if you choose fewer samples. If the total cost of your selected samples exceeds Rs.500, the additional amount will be charged separately.</p>
                
				<h6>3. How long will it take for delivery?</h6>
				<p>We ship via DHL, UPS, or another reliable courier service, with an estimated delivery time of 3 to 5 days. You can track your parcel on the courier's website using the tracking code we provide.</p>
                
				<h6>4. Can you deliver to a relative or friend in India to save on courier charges?</h6>
				<p>Yes, this is possible.</p>
                
				<h6>5. Can payment be made in Indian Rupees through a relative or friend in India?</h6>
				<p>Yes, this option is available.</p>
                
				<h6>6. Is the sample cost deductible from the final order?</h6>
				<p>If your final order exceeds INR 1000 (excluding shipping), we will deduct the sample cost from the total order value. However, courier charges for the samples will not be deducted. We encourage you to compare our prices with other sites before finalizing your decision.</p>
                
				<h6>7. What does the sample card include? Will it be printed with my text?</h6>
				<p>Sample cards are sent blank. If you would like them printed with your text, additional printing charges will apply.</p>
                
				<h6>8. Do you provide printing services? What are the printing charges?</h6>
				<p>Yes, we offer full printing services. Printing charges vary depending on the card type, printing method (screen, offset, foil), and the number of components (e.g., card, cover, insert, RSVP card) to be printed.</p>

                <h6>9. How long does it take to deliver printed cards?</h6>
				<p>Once you order the samples and send us your wedding text in Word format, we will start designing and send you proofs. By the time you receive and choose the samples, we will have a basic proof ready. After the final order is confirmed and payment is received, printing and packing take approximately 7-10 days. The entire process, from order to delivery, should take about 2-3 weeks.</p>

                <h6>10. Do you provide add-on cards, such as RSVP and Thank You cards?</h6>
				<p>Yes, we offer a full range of add-on cards. Please contact our customer support for more information.</p>

                <h6>11. What is the process for approving proofs?</h6>
				<p>Send us your text in Word or text format, and we will design it using appropriate fonts and styles. Proofs will be sent to you as JPEG images for your review and approval. If changes are needed, we will provide revised proofs until you are satisfied. Printing will only commence after final approval. Cards are screen printed, and foil stamping is available at an additional cost. If you need help with wedding wording or prefer specific fonts, we can accommodate your requests.</p>

                <h6>12. What languages and fonts are available for printing on the card?</h6>
				<p>We can typeset in most Indian languages, as well as English. We also have a large selection of fonts, and if you have a specific font in mind, you can send it to us (provided it complies with copyright laws).</p>

                <h6>13. Can you provide additional inserts, envelopes, or plastic covers for the cards?</h6>
				<p>Yes, we can supply extra inserts, pages, or envelopes according to your requirements. There will be an additional charge for these items, and printing costs may also increase. For more information, contact us at rubycardzindia@gmail.com

</p>

                <h6>14. Are there any additional taxes, levies, or duties?</h6>
				<p>No, our prices are inclusive of all taxes.</p>
